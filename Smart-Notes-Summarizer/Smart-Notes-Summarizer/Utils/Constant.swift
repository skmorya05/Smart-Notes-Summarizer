    Artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming the way people handle information.
    Students and professionals often take lengthy notes during meetings, lectures, or research sessions,
    but reviewing them later can be time-consuming. A Smart Notes Summarizer helps by extracting the key ideas
    from a large block of text and presenting them as concise bullet points with a one-line overview.
    This saves time, improves recall, and allows users to focus on action items rather than rereading pages of content.
    Modern summarizers can even adapt their style—formal, casual, or technical—depending on the user’s preference.
    By integrating directly into a notes app, the summarizer encourages consistent note-taking and faster knowledge retention.
